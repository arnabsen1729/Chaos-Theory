A simple illustration on fractals. 

Fractals are beautiful. In this case the Sierpinski triangle generated from a simple strategy. Let's say you have 3 pts A, B, C. Let's assign two numbers to each of them. 1 and 2 to A, 3 and 4 to B, 5 and 6 to C. Now, take a point (x, y). Also plot A, B, C on a graph. Now roll the dice. If you get 1, 2 then the new point will be mid way between (x, y) and A. Keep doing the same for B and C, and keep repeating this. 

Lo and Behold you get a beautiful Serpenski Triangle (which comes under the family of fractals)
